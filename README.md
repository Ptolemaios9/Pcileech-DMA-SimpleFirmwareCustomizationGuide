# Pcileech-FirmwareCustomizationGuide
This guide teaches you how to stand on the shoulders of giants and use open source projects to make your own private firmware！

😊I hate firmware “experts” who make crap firmware and sell it for a high price，That's why this guide has been created, so you can get started with zero experience!
